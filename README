Release: v0.1
Description: This is a fork of an Arch script created by deadhead420 to pull up the Manjaro wiki pages quickly from the terminal.

NOTE:
For this script to work it requires lynx as a dependency.

pacman -S lynx

HOW TO USE:
The simplest way to use my script is to copy wiki.sh to your path. Copy the script
to ~/bin or /usr/local/bin note you will likely need sudo privelege to write 
to /usr/local/bin. 
Also note when copying to path don't include the .sh extension,
this way the command you run will be wiki, not wiki.sh.

example:
sudo cp wiki.sh /usr/local/bin/wiki

Once you have copied the script to your path you can simply run wiki from anywhere
on the command line to pull up the manjaro wiki. To search pass an argument to the command.
wiki <search args here>

example:
wiki ssh
wiki lamp
wiki Manjaro Build System

This will pull up your search on the Manjaro wiki and display it to you in the terminal

Thanks to deadhead420 for allowing me to port this for manjaro
